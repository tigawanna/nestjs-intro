## Module 
A fundamental building block that acts as a container for various components like controllers, services, and other related functionalities. It's like a Lego brick that helps you structure and organize your application in a clean and modular way. Here are some key points about NestJS modules:

**how to generate module**

> **Note:** use the plural form of the module name.
```sh
nest g module module_name
```

**What they do:**

* **Organize code:** Modules group related functionalities together, making your codebase easier to navigate and understand. Imagine having a module for user management, another for product management, and so on.
* **Encapsulation:** Modules encapsulate dependencies within themselves, meaning components within a module can access each other easily without needing to know about components in other modules. This promotes loose coupling and improves maintainability.
* **Dependency injection:** Modules facilitate NestJS's powerful dependency injection mechanism, where dependencies are injected into components automatically based on their needs. This simplifies development and improves testability.
* **Reusability:** Modules can be reused across different parts of your application or even in other projects, promoting code reuse and reducing development time.

**Key features:**

* **Decorated with `@Module()`:** Each module class is annotated with the `@Module()` decorator, providing metadata to NestJS about its components and dependencies.
* **Multiple components:** Modules can contain controllers (handle HTTP requests), services (business logic), providers (data access, logging, etc.), and other components.
* **Hierarchical structure:** Modules can be nested within other modules, creating a hierarchical structure for complex applications.
* **Dynamic modules:** NestJS also allows for dynamic modules, which can be configured and created on the fly based on specific needs.

**Benefits of using modules:**

* **Improved organization:** Makes code easier to understand and maintain.
* **Reusability:** Reduces code duplication and development time.
* **Loose coupling:** Promotes independent development and testing of modules.
* **Scalability:** Makes it easier to scale your application as it grows.



## Service

a workhorse responsible for encapsulating the core business logic of your application. It's like a dedicated employee handling specific tasks without being burdened by other concerns. Here's a deeper look at what NestJS services are and how they contribute:

**how to generate service**
> **Note:** use the plural form of the service name.
```sh
nest g service service_name
```

**What they do:**

* **Encapsulate business logic:** Services house the logic needed to perform specific operations, such as querying databases, manipulating data, interacting with external APIs, or handling complex calculations. This keeps controllers lean and focused on request handling.
* **Separation of concerns:** By separating business logic from controllers, services promote clean architecture and maintainability. Each service handles a specific domain, making the code easier to understand and modify.
* **Reusability:** Services can be reused across different controllers and even other parts of your application, reducing code duplication and development time.
* **Testability:** Independent services with well-defined functionalities are easier to unit test, ensuring the reliability of your application's core logic.

**Key features:**

* **Plain JavaScript classes:** Services are defined as regular JavaScript classes, often utilizing TypeScript for type safety and advanced features.
* **Decorated with `@Injectable()`:** The `@Injectable()` decorator marks a service as injectable, allowing other components like controllers to access its methods and properties.
* **Dependencies:** Services can have dependencies on other services or providers, which are injected through the constructor, promoting loose coupling and modularity.
* **Methods:** Services contain methods that implement the desired business logic, providing specific functionalities for your application.

**Benefits of using services:**

* **Clean architecture:** Separates concerns and promotes maintainability.
* **Reusability:** Reduces code duplication and saves development time.
* **Testability:** Enhances the testability of your application's core logic.
* **Scalability:** Makes it easier to scale your application as complexity grows.




## Controller

In NestJS, a controller acts as the entry point for your application's HTTP requests. It's like a receptionist in a building, receiving visitors (requests) and directing them to the appropriate departments (services) within your application. Here's a breakdown of what NestJS controllers do:


> **Note:** Use the plural form of controller name
```sh
nest g controller controller_name
```

**What they do:**

* **Handle HTTP requests:** Controllers receive incoming HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) based on defined routes. They act as the first responders, analyzing the request details like URL, headers, and body.
* **Process requests:** Controllers extract relevant information from the request, call upon necessary services to perform business logic, and prepare appropriate responses.
* **Return responses:** Controllers send back responses to the client, including data, status codes, and other relevant information.
* **Define routes:** Controllers use decorators like `@Get()`, `@Post()`, and others to associate themselves with specific URL paths and HTTP methods, making them responsible for handling those requests.

**Key features:**

* **Decorated with `@Controller()`:** Each controller class is marked with the `@Controller()` decorator, defining it as a controller and potentially specifying a base path for all its routes.
* **Route-handling methods:** Controller methods are decorated with specific route decorators like `@Get('/')` to indicate which URL path and HTTP method they handle.
* **Request handling:** Methods within controllers usually extract data from the request, call services for processing, and format the response based on the request type and business logic.
* **Dependency injection:** Controllers can inject dependent services using the constructor or method parameters, ensuring loose coupling and testability.

**Benefits of using controllers:**

* **Clear separation of concerns:** Keeps controllers focused on request handling, while services handle business logic, promoting clean architecture.
* **Modularity:** Each controller can handle a specific domain or functionality, making your application easier to understand and maintain.
* **Testability:** Independent controllers with well-defined routes and functionalities are easier to unit test, ensuring the reliability of your application's interaction with HTTP requests.
* **Maintainability:** By handling requests in dedicated controllers, you can easily modify and extend your application's functionality without affecting other parts.
